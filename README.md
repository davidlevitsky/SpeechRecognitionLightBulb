Base code (not yet functional) was provided by CodePath in an Android Meetup in San Francisco. A few lines of code were added to make the lightbulb change after recognizing key words by setting up a SpeechRecognitionManager.
After initializing the SpeechRecognitionManager by saying "ok light", the user can say "turn blue", "turn pink", "hide", or "show" to alter the state of the lightbulb.

Technologies used:

- Google Voice Recognition API
- Pocket Sphinx for Android
